16,1016,RESPONSE,the tones were hard for me to remember. 
17,1017,RESPONSE,"Trying to capture the tone and repeat low, medium high. But the math is extremely distracting when you suck at math. "

23,1023,RESPONSE,Instead of trying to remember the whole word (ex. medium)m) I would use the first letter ande repeat it after each one adding them all together at the end. 
24,1024,RESPONSE,I didn't use any tricks. I just did the simple math in my head while saying the tones over in my head again. 
25,1025,RESPONSE,"I would try to just look at the math problem without finding the answer and then see if the answer shown was correct, then memorized the notes given  "

29,1033,RESPONSE,I just repeated the pattern in my head as i solved the problems. 
30,1034,RESPONSE,"It was very difficult at first to try to remember the tones without a tool or strategy, but once I started using the fingers on my left hand as a reminder of L,M,H notes it was much easier to recall the patterns. i also started repeating the sequence mentally each time a new tone would play to reinforce what I had already heard. I used my pinky finger as low, middle finger as finger as M, and thumb as High, siimilar to when I played the piano.  "

43,1049,RESPONSE,memorizing the letter of the tones 
44,1050,RESPONSE,I sang along to them in my head at first and would repeat them so that they stacked on top of each other in the right order. If it was a long set I would invision the HLM scale and try to remember in what order they would go in )(like completing a path))

47,1300,RESPONSE,assigning tones to my fingers and memorizing the tapping patterns 
48,1301,RESPONSE,"I repeated the names of the tones (hs - high, low, medium - and strung them together as I completed the math exercises. The names of the tones were easier to remember than singing them back in my head, for example. That was a strategy I used first, but since the tones don't make tonal sense, and are so disjunct (in space and time), I made less mistake "
49,1302,NO RESPONSE,
50,1303,RESPONSE,"I used three fingers after each math problem and if the tone was high,medium,or low i would place my fingers according to the tone. So if my first tone is high, my first finger will be the place at the highest part on the table, then if my second tone is low, my second finger will be the lowest height. For the repeat tones, i would tap my fingers "
51,1304,RESPONSE,I used the fingers on my left hand as if i was playing three different notes on a piano to help remember the patterns and tones. 
52,1305,RESPONSE,"Don't think about the math problems. Just forget the math as soon as you're done with the problem. I like to move my finger and point to the left, middle, or right depending on the tone and keep repeating the pattern everytime a new tone is added. "

60,507,EMAILED ," I remember I would memorize the tones in a make-shift """"melodic"""" sense, like I would sing it to myself without humming or making any audible sound, essentially just emulating the tones in my mind. I would then use the created melody in my head to determine which tones of HML came at which points in time. I would also move my head in a motion correlating to the pitch of the tone (up/right for H, middle for M, down/left for L) in order to also make use of muscle memory for better memorization/regurgitation of the ex"

62,509,NO RESPONSE,
63,510,EMAILED ," During this portion of theexperiment I mainly used one strategy. I assigned each tone (H,M,L) a finger on my left hand (index, middle, ring) and tapped out the pattern of tones I recognized with each corresponding finger. I was able to complete the math problems while still remembering and adding to the pattern I was recording in my left hand. I found this strategy to work very well."
64,511,EMAILED ," As far as remembering the tones, I used my hands to remind myself which direction the tones went. For example: for the higher tones I pointed up, for the middle tones I pointed straight, and for the lower tones I pointed down. When I did the math equations, I was able to remember my hand patterns much better than I could remember the notes alone."
65,512,EMAILED , I would try to use as little brain power as possible to solve the math problem then say the answer in my head over and over while also trying to remember the pitch.
66,513,NO RESPONSE,
67,514,EMAILED , The main strategy I remember using was to remember each note and treat it like i was creating a melody note by note and just adding onto the melody with each question.
68,515,NO RESPONSE,
69,516,EMAILED ," Well that's incredibly unfortunate! My response was something along the lines of: I assigned each of my fingers on my left hand a pitch and tried to recall the order in which I tapped them after answering the math problems. I also tried recognizing patterns within the organization of pitches, as in it follows an ascending to depending pattern or whatever else."

87,534,EMAILED ," I tried to continuously repeat the words """"hi"""", """"lo"""" and """"mid"""" (like a chant somewhat) in the correct pattern of the tones, adding on each time I heard a new tone. I also sometimes tried to imagine them visually as a high dot, a middle dot, and a low dot and would sort of •À_hop•À_ from one to the other in my brain and create a path that represented the tone orders. I tried to keep these things continuously on a loop in the back of my head while trying to use as little of my focus as possible to answer the math problems and still get them right."
88,535,EMAILED ," I just sang the notes to myself, and came up with rhymes to remember the sequences sometimes. With the math, I just made sure not to overthink what I was doing."
89,536,NO RESPONSE,
90,537,EMAILED ," I made a finger stand for each high, low, or medium sound, and I would move my finger in a different position every time the pitch was played, to remember the number of times each pitch was played. Then I just focused on memorizing the order of the tunes. "

99,546,EMAILED , I would just remember the first letter of each tone type and keep repeating that in my head as I solved the math problems.
100,547,EMAILED ," A few strategies I used in the experiment were audiating the pitches in my head as if i were simply remembering my favorite song as i did the math. It was very relaxed as to avoid the stress of """"trying"""" to remember something."
101,548,NO RESPONSE,
102,549,EMAILED , Some strategies I used for remembering tone while solving math equations were repeating the tones in order in my head over and over until I came to the screen where I input them and did so to the best of my knowledge.
103,550,NO RESPONSE,
104,551,EMAILED , I believe in that task I assigned a letter to each tone and was able to keep track of the pattern in my head. Audiating the pitches while repeating the pattern was also very helpful.

107,554,NO RESPONSE,
108,555,EMAILED , I remember using my fingers to represent low middle and high tones and then created a pattern by tapping the corresponding finger to the note it represented when I heard the tones being played. While I had that pattern I solved the math problems like normal in the midst of it

135,725,RESPONSE,"For the most part I could remember the shape of the line between tones. The pattern of Low High Middle I remember as the NBC tune. But I for the most part just got the contour of the series, which is simple with only three tones. It would be much more difficult if there were any more.  "
